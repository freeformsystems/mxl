.SH "NAME"
mxl-run -- Source tmux configuration files.
.SH "USAGE"

.SP
mxl run [\-e] [\-e|\-\-each] [\-s|\-\-session=<name>] <args> <file> <dir>

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Invokes \fBtmux source\-file\fR with the configuration files found by evaluating 
.br
the arguments, use the \fB\-\-noop\fR option to inspect what would be executed.
.PP
Arguments can be directories, files, alias references and file pattern matching 
.br
expressions.
.PP
See mxl\-alias(1) for more information on aliases.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.BL
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fB\-e, \-\-each\fR: Iterate child directories and set \fB\-c\fR for each directory.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fB\-s, \-\-session=<name>\fR: Create session before source file(s).
.EL
.SH "EACH"
.PP
The \fB\-\-each\fR switch changes the behaviour of execution to take the value of 
.br
\fB\-c | \-\-directory\fR (which will be the working directory if not specified) 
.br
find all direct child directories and iterate the result executing 
.br
all matched configuration files for each directory found.
.PP
This feature is designed for a project comprising of modules:

.SP
  project
.br
  ├── client
.br
  ├── db
.br
  ├── server
.br
  └── tmux.conf
.PP
You can execute the commands in \fBtmux.conf\fR for each module with:

  cd project && mxl \-\-each
.PP
Typically used to open a window and pane set for all modules of a project from 
.br
a single configuration file.
.PP
When the \fB\-\-each\fR flag is used the behaviour of \fB\-\-pattern\fR changes to 
.br
match the child working directory path rather than the configuration file 
.br
path(s) so that it may be used as a filter.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
Before calls to \fBsource\-file\fR the following environment variables are set 
.br
using \fBset\-environment \-g\fR:
.BL
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBmxl_key\fR: An identifier for a session or window.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBmxl_file\fR: The path to the configuration file.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBmxl_filename\fR: The name of the configuration file.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBmxl_cwd\fR: The working directory for the \fBtmux\fR process.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBmxl_cwdname\fR: The name of the working directory.
.EL
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Source \fBtmux.conf\fR in the current working directory:

  mxl
.PP
Source a file by directory:

  mxl /usr/local/project
.PP
Source all \fB*.tmux.conf\fR files in the current working directory (and \fBtmux.conf\fR 
.br
if present):

  mxl \-a
.PP
Use a pattern match on the file path to filter results returned with \fB\-a\fR using 
.br
the \fB\-p\fR option:

  mxl \-a \-p 'test'
.PP
Source a file by alias reference:

  mxl @project
.PP
Source with multiple arguments:

  mxl @project @alt\-project /usr/local/project
