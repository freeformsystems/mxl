Tmux Launcher
=============

Tmux launcher.

Launches tmux profiles by invoking `source-file` ensuring your tmux 
configurations are completely portable, see [tmux.conf](https://github.com/freeformsystems/mxl/blob/master/tmux.conf).

Requires [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](http://www.npmjs.org).

## Install

```
npm i -g mxl
```

## Usage

```
mxl -h
mxl help
mxl help <cmd>
```

Start `tmux` and define commands in a `tmux.conf` file within a project,  add 
additional profiles by using the `.tmux.conf` suffix.

```conf
# vim: set ft=conf:
new-window -n mxl
send-keys -t: 'vim .' C-m
split-window -h -t:
send-keys -t: 'git status' C-m
select-pane -L
```

Use the `ls` command to see matching configuration files:

```
mxl ls
mxl ls -a
mxl ls :test
```

Prefix an argument with `:` to treat the argument as a profile pattern matching 
regular expression, matches are performed on the file name.

Launch `tmux.conf` in the current working directory:

```
mxl
```

Launch all profiles (`tmux.conf` and `*.tmux.conf`) in the current working 
directory:

```
mxl -a
```

Perform file name regular expression matching using a `:profile` reference:

```
mxl :test
```

Launch `tmux.conf` in current working directory with another target directory:

```
mxl -c /usr/local/project
```

This is particularly useful when you have a common configuration file that you 
wish to share across multiple projects.
